## Introduction

This application is designed to provide a robust and scalable RESTful API using the Node.js runtime, the Express.js framework, and PostgreSQL as the database management system. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete data, making it suitable for various application backend needs.

## Features

- **RESTful Routes:** Utilize the full range of RESTful routes for managing resources, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The combination of Node.js and Express provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications.
- **PostgreSQL Integration:** Leverage the power of PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database, for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Middleware:** Employ middleware for tasks such as authentication, validation, and logging to enhance your API's functionality and security.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to provide clear and meaningful error messages to clients.
- **Documentation:** Document your API's endpoints, request/response formats, and usage guidelines to facilitate integration for other developers.
